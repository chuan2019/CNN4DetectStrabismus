# Detecting Strabismus with Convolutional NeuralÂ Networks

The code in this repo consists two parts. The first part mainly includes image preprocessing and CNN classifier model training/testing; second part includes a web service using Python with Flask framework, which wraps up the pre-trained CNN classifier model on the backend. User can use the web service to help diagnose if a subject has strabismus or not.

As of Jan. 2022, the first part of the code is under refactorization for better readability and manageability, and rewriting the second part is planned. During this refactorization, both pylint and unit tests are added into the CI/CD workflow.
